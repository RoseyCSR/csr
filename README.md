# CSR

Our team will be developing a website for our Computer Science teacher Mr Brown. He has told us how he would find a website aiding him in providing his students with organised class resources and practice questions with solutions very helpful. We aim to satisfy the requirements for this website.  While we may not know everything required for the development yet, we will teach ourselves the areas that we are lacking in. We plan to use a database hosted online for the storage of data and programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  Mr Brown has agreed to be our supervisor for this project, and we will have meetings with him to discuss our progress. We anticipate that this project will take a month to complete. We have decided to initially name this project CSR (Computer Science Resources).
